But you are not listening to me)\nThis song can be interpreted as being sung either by Radha\u0026rsquo;s beloved, a sakhi (friend) or her mother in an attempt to pacify her anger.

This type of concert involves a male and a female singer singing the same keyboard notes in 2 different ragas (scales) using the concept of mode shifting or murchana.\nBackground Transposition In various forms of modal music, it is common to obtain multiple scales from the same set of notes by just changing the tonic note. This concept is called murchana in Indian classical music. Below is an example of such a type of murchana where the singer, Gayatri, sings the notes of raga Chandrakauns in the concert tonic, i.e. G# (playing in the tanpuras), followed by the same keyboard notes in raga Madhukauns by assuming the tonic to be the madhyam (fourth note), i.e. C# above the concert tonic.  The video is a snippet from a Ranjani Gayatri concert posted on YouTube available here.  \nJasrangi Jugalbandi (JJ) This type of concert was first conceptualised by Pt. Jasraj in the year 2012. Since male and female vocalists usually have natural vocal ranges that differ by around 5-7 semitones, this concert allows them to sing in their comfortable tonics (Sa) using the concept of murchana with the same notes.\nHere is an example of such a concert by Dr. Ashwini Bhide Deshpande and Pt. Sanjeev Abhyankar singing ragas Abhogi and Kalavati respectively.   Our Research Motivations Through our conversations with musicians we identified the following challenges during interaction of singers in this format of concert:\n The singers have to preserve raga specific characteristics They also have to meaningfully link phrases  Hence we sought to analyse the following:\n Study the extent to which individual raga-specific characteristics are preserved in a JJ concert Study the interation between the 2 singers in the JJ concert  Research Material Our paper will be presented in ISMIR 2021 and can be found here.\nHere is a video of me talking about our research paper:   \n","permalink":"https://snnithya.github.io/portfolio/jj/","tags":["MIR","Raga Music"],"title":"Computational Analysis of Melodic Mode Switching"},{"categories":["Music"],"contents":"This was a fun cover of the song labb par aaye, from the tv series Bandish Bandits, that I did with my friend Anjali Upadhyaya.
